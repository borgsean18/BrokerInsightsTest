<h1> Broker Insights Code Test </h1>

1. I created a C# console application to tackle this code test.
2. To run the application please make sure the CsvHelper Nuget package is installed.
3. To compile the CSV data correctly please go to the MainScript in the application and find lines 12 and 13. Please replace the hard coded file paths to match your local location of the CSV files used for this code test.
4. Please also change the hard coded outputFilePath on like 16 of MainScript.cs to match where you want the outputted file to be saved.
